        Hi, I'm Felix Zhu, a recent graduate with a Bachelor's degree in
        Computer Science from Stony Brook University, where I developed a strong
        foundation in software development and technology. Passionate about
        creating efficient and innovative solutions, I am eager to leverage my
        academic background and hands-on experience to embark on a career in
        software development.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        My technical skills include Java, Python, React, Node.js, SQL, and more,
        which I continually refine through personal projects and ongoing
        learning initiatives. Beyond coding, I find joy in exploring 3D
        printing, building computers, and immersing myself in video games. These
        hobbies not only complement my technical skills but also fuel my
        creativity and problem-solving abilities.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        I'm eager to kick-start my career in software development. Explore my
        projects and coursework, and let's connect! I'm actively seeking
        opportunities to contribute my skills and passion to innovative teams.
